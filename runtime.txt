First:
Insert 654.5708 ms
Append 3.3489 ms

tinyArray:
Insert - 669.5629 ms
Append - 3.6047

smallArray:
Insert - 657.958 ms
Append - 2.849 ms

mediumArray:
Insert - 671.9617 ms 
Append - 3.3733 ms

largeArray: 
Insert - 664.8064 ms 
Append - 3.4896 ms

extraLargeArray:
Insert - 664.1536 ms
Append - 4.5349 ms


It seems to me that the smallArray is the best function, the Append time is the lowest out of all the arrays.
Even though the Insert time took a little bit longer than the first one, the first test I did at the top was 
me testing the function without an array plugged into the function. 

It seems like the higher the array goes it has a longer append time.

I think the append function scales better. It is easier for me to read. Because the time on it is less than the insert.
The .push method scales better because it has a runtime of 4.6 rather than an insert runtime that scales at 664.2 on the extraLargeArray.
